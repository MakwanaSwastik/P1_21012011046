This repository contains a collection of Java programs that demonstrate various fundamental concepts and functionalities. Each program is designed to showcase a specific aspect of Java programming. Below is a brief overview of each program included in this repository:

## 1. Store & Display Values in Different Variables
Program 1.1 showcases the creation and display of variables of different data types, including Integer, Double, Float, Long, Short, Byte, Char, Boolean, and String.

## 2. Type Conversion
Program 1.2 demonstrates type conversions, such as Integer to Double, String to Integer, and String to Double.

## 3. Scan Studentâ€™s Information
Program 1.3 allows users to input and display data of students, including their name, enrollment number, branch, etc.

## 4. Check Odd or Even Numbers
Program 1.4 determines whether a number is odd or even using control flow within the `println()` method.

## 5. Display Month Name
Program 1.5 uses a `when` expression to display the month name based on user input.

## 6. User-Defined Function
Program 1.6 creates a user-defined function to perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two numbers.

## 7. Factorial Calculation with Recursion
Program 1.7 calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.

## 8. Working with Arrays
Program 1.8 explores various array operations, including `Arrays.deepToString()`, `contentDeepToString()`, `IntArray.joinToString()`, and utilizes different loop types like range, `downTo`, `until`, etc., to manipulate arrays. It also demonstrates sorting an array of integers both with and without built-in functions.

## 9. Find Maximum Number from ArrayList
Program 1.9 is a program that finds the maximum number from an ArrayList of integers.

## 10. Class and Constructor Creation
Program 1.10 defines different classes and constructors. It includes a "Car" class with properties like type, model, price, owner, and miles driven. The program implements functions to get car information, original car price, current car price, and display car information.

## 11. Operator Overloading and Matrix Operations
Program 1.11 explains operator overloading and implements matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication using a "Matrix" class. It also overloads the `toString()` function in the "Matrix" class for customized output.

Feel free to explore each program individually and refer to the source code and documentation for more details on how these functionalities are implemented. Enjoy learning and experimenting with Java programming through these examples!

Please refer to the respective program's source code and documentation for detailed information on how each of these functionalities is achieved.
